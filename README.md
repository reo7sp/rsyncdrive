# rsyncdrive

Bash script for syncing your code or other files via rsync.

It excludes all ".git" dirs and all files mentioned in ".gitignore" files from syncing. The local backups are powered by git versioning.

To configure this script edit variables which are in the beginning of the "rsyncdrive.sh".
